# Diskripper

Diskripper is a tool which can analyze and extract files from an image file, without downloading the whole image file. This can be particularly useful when you find a network share during a pentest with VMDK files for example. Some of these files can be as big as a  couple hundreds of gigabytes. To download all of it costs a lot of time and storage space, both of which can be quite limited. Diskripper is created to form a solution to that problem.
